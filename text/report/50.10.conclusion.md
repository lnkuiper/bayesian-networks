# Conclusion
TODO: actually write out this mockup

Answer these questions:

  - Which people should the bank target? For example, people with certain types
    of jobs or education might be more susceptible to a term deposit.
  - Given a certain person, what is the best time to call this him/her? For
    example, students do not like being called early in the morning.
  - How important is the current state of the economy for making this decision?
    Should the bank target different people as the economy evolves?

Current state of the economy is a better predictor of outcome than personal variables.
That state may in general predict a persons economic status better than a persons history.
Time/day is not a good predictor, we found this even before applying the model using a SEM.
