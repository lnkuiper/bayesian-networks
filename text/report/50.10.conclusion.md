# Conclusion
TODO: actually write out this mockup

Answer these questions:

  - Which people should the bank target? For example, people with certain types
    of jobs or education might be more susceptible to a term deposit.
  - Given a certain person, what is the best time to call this him/her? For
    example, students do not like being called early in the morning.
  - How important is the current state of the economy for making this decision?
    Should the bank target different people as the economy evolves?


Looking back at our project it is a surprising / serendipitous result that the state of the economy, as opposed to who someone is, is most important in the result of whether or not someone will take out a loan at the bank.
This is not to say that personal variables do not matter, but the extent to which they do is considerably smaller.

Variables such as time and day were found to be bad predictors. This was already found before applying the model using a SEM.
