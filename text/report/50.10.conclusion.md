# Conclusion

Looking back at our project it is a surprising / serendipitous result that the state of the economy, as opposed to who someone is, is most important in the result of whether or not someone will take out a loan at the bank.
This is not to say that personal variables do not matter, but the extent to which they do is considerably smaller.

Variables such as time and day were found to be bad predictors. This was already found before applying the model using a SEM.

We've found that, independent of economic variables, the bank should target older single people that do not have a loan in default, with marginal preference for people with a higher education.
Additionaly, we've found no preference for a moment to call someone, independent of who this person is.
We've found that the current state of the economy is very important with respect to the likelihood that someone takes out a loan.
Lastly we've found that we cannot conclude whether to target different people when the economy changes, as a result of bias present in the data.
