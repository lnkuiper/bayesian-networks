# Application
We apply our bayesian network by fitting it as a SEM on the data. SEMs require
continuous data, therefore we need to use a model that accepts it. Our tested
model does not accept this, so we chose to use the model that was learned using the PC algorithm.

## Markov Blanket SEM
To answer our research questions, only variables that predict outcome variables
_y_ are important. Therefore we extract the Markov blanket of _y_ from the
network using the `bnlearn` package. The includes only the variables `age`,
`default`, `single`, `nr.employed`, `cons.conf.idx`, `cons.price.idx`, and
`emp.var.rate`. Initially we expected the variables `job`, `education` to be
part of the blanket.

The Markov blanket DAG is transformed into a format that the `lavaan` library
accepts. Then, the function `fit()` is called with the DAG and the data as
parameters to fit the SEM, and a summary is printed of the fitted model to
display the coefficients. We encountered some confusing results with most
coefficients being extremely low, which caused us to wonder why PC had learned
these edges. We soon realized that this could be fixed by standardizing the
values in the data. After standardization the coefficients were more easily
interpretable.

The coefficients of the variables in the Markov blanket with _y_ are shown in
\autoref{sec:sem_learned}.
