# Results
We apply our bayesian network by fitting it as a SEM on the data. SEMs require
continuous data, so we need to use a model that accepts it. Our tested model
does not accept this, therefore we chose to use the model that was learned 
using the PC algorithm.

To answer our research questions, only variables that predict outcome variables
_y_ are important. Therefore we extract the Markov blanket of _y_ from the
network using the `bnlearn` package, and transform it into an input format that
the `lavaan` library accepts. Then, we simply use the function `fit()` to fit
the SEM, and print a summary of the fitted model to display the coefficients.

We encountered some weird results with coefficients being extremely low, which
caused us to wonder why PC had learned these edges. We soon realized that this
could be fixed by standardizing the values in the data. After standardizing it
was much easier to interpret the SEM coefficients.

Show results, refer to appendix.
Blah blah blah...
