## Research questions
We are mainly interested in which variables influence the customer's decision
subscribing to a term deposit. We will be able to learn which variables affect
the decision, and how large their effect size is. Using the final model, we
can advise the bank about:

  - Which people should the bank target? For example, people with certain types
    of jobs or education might be more susceptible to a term deposit.
  - Given a certain person, what is the best time to call this him/her? For
    example, students do not like being called early in the morning.
  - How important is the current state of the economy for making this decision?
    Should the bank target different people as the economy evolves?
