# Discussion

We enjoyed working on this project a lot and feel like we learned a lot.
Looking back, we are quite satisfied how it turned out.
During the course of this project, we learned many things about working with Bayesian networks, from pre-processing to applying the model. Summing up, we learned how to:

  - construct a Bayesian network based on domain knowledge, how to inspect and visualise data for bias and incorrect or missing data;
  - bin and order bins, based on data distribution and domain knowledge;
  - apply inference algorithms to reason probabilisticly in Bayesian networks;
  - statiscally evaluate the fit of a Bayesian network model to a dataset using several independence tests;
  - generate structural equation models using structure learning algorithms;
  - apply a Bayesian network in order to answer causal questions about the original problem domain, based on data in this domain.

We feel that a strong point of our project is that the model made by testing has many similarities with the model that was automatically learned from the data, even though these were made with data that was pre-processed differently (nominal binning vs. ordered continuous), and had different independence tests.
This indicates that our pre-processing choices were valid, and contributed to the validity of the model.

Areas where we feel our current work could be improved are as follows:

  - We did not bin certain numerical attributes in our data before starting the model testing, only during. In the course of the course we learned of the benefit of binning our data with respect to the tests, but we did not start over with the model testing on this binned version of the dataset. We do feel that this shouldn't have had a substantial impact on the end result, because we also evaluated the value of adding edges to the network, as opposed to only removing them.
  - The ordering we decided on for the attribute "job" should be scrutinized. It is currently based on our intuition with respect to the problem domain combined with income data for these jobs we retrieved online, but it is still not a given whether to group "entrepeneur" and "self-employed" together and where to place this group in relation to other groups. Ideally this grouping should be verified by checking the coÃ«fficient between "education" and "job".

If we were to redo this project, we would bin the data before model testing, instead of doing this during this process when we found out that it was important.
We would also use a correlation test instead of the chi-square test during independence testing in order to mitigate the problems caused by a lack of data points for certain combinations of variable instantiations.
Lastly, we would have liked to introduce an ordering between bins before model testing, instead of before learning the SEM, in order to increase the amount of information captured by the data, to increase the significance of the independence tests, and to make applying the tested model easier.
