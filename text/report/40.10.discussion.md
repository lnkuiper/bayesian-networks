# Discussion

We enjoyed working on this project a lot and feel like we learned a lot.
Looking back, we are quite satisfied how it turned out.

- Gebinde data model testing (partieel)
- Ordering van job

During the course of this project, we learned a lot of things. We learned how to:

  - construct a Bayesian network based on domain knowledge, how to inspect and visualise data for bias and incorrect or missing data.
  - bin and order bins, based on data distribution and domain knowledge.
  - apply inference algorithms to reason probabilisticly in Bayesian networks.
  - statiscally evaluate the fit of a Bayesian network model to a dataset using several independence tests.
  - generate structural equation models using structure learning algorithms.
  - apply a Bayesian network in order to answer causal questions about the original problem domain, based on data in this domain.

If we were to redo this project, we would bin the data before model testing, instead of doing this during this process.
We would also use a correlation test instead of the chi-square test during independence testing in order to mitigate the problems caused by a lack of data points for certain combinations of variable instantiations.
Lastly, we would've introduced an ordering between bins already before model testing, instead of before learning the SEM, in order to increase the amount of information captured by the data, to increase the significance of the independence tests.







Dependency between marital and economic indicators found.
This happened both in testing and learning.
Might be due to call targeting strategy.
