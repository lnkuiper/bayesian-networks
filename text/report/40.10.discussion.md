[Reflect on your project.]

[What are the strong and weak points?]


- Gebinde data model testing (partieel)
- Ordering van job

[What did you learn?]

If we were to redo this project, we would bin the data before model testing, instead of doing this during this process.
We would also use a correlation test instead of the chi-square test during independence testing in order to mitigate the problems caused by a lack of data points for certain combinations of variable instantiations.
Lastly, we would've introduced an ordering between bins already before model testing, instead of before learning the SEM, in order to increase the amount of information captured by the data, to increase the significance of the independence tests.







Dependency between marital and economic indicators found.
This happened both in testing and learning.
Might be due to call targeting strategy.
