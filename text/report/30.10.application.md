# Application
We apply a model to the data to find an answer our research questions.

## Structural Equation Models
We apply our bayesian network by fitting it as a structural equation model
(SEM) on the data. SEMs require continuous data, therefore we need to use a
model that accepts it. Our tested model does not accept this, so instead we
used the model that was learned with the PC algorithm.

### Markov Blanket SEM
To answer our research questions, only variables that predict outcome variables
_y_ are important. Therefore we extract the Markov blanket of _y_ from the
network using the `bnlearn` package. The only includes the variables `age`,
`default`, `single`, `nr.employed`, `cons.conf.idx`, `cons.price.idx`, and
`emp.var.rate`.

The Markov blanket DAG is transformed into a format that the `lavaan` library
accepts. Then, the function `fit()` is called with the DAG and the data as
parameters to fit the SEM. The coefficients are then printed by calling the
`summary()` function. We encountered some confusing values with most
coefficients being extremely low, which caused us to wonder why PC had learned
these edges. We realized that this could be solved by standardizing the values
in the data. After standardization the coefficients were on the same
scale, and therefore more interpretable.

The coefficients of the variables in the Markov blanket are shown in \autoref
{sec:sem_learned}, in the _Estimate_ column. These are not all the coefficients
in the SEM, just those that influence  _y_. We can see that the variables that
are related to the person (`age`, `default`, `single`) have a positive or
negative coefficient of less than 0.05, while the variables that have to do 
with the national state of the economy have higher coefficients, ranging from
0.1 to 0.3.

### Variables not in Markov Blanket
In the model that we made by testing we felt that the variables `education` and
`job` would have a big influence on the outcome _y_. They were connected to 
each other, and to the outcome variable through the latent variable `wealth`.
However, they did not appear in the Markov blanket of the learned structure.

We are still interested in their influence on the outcome, therefore we 
manually change the Markov blanket to include them. Both are connected directly
to _y_, and `education` is connected to `job`. The SEM is fit again, and a
summary is displayed. The coefficients are shown in \autoref
{sec:sem_learned_edujob}.

These variables turn out to be weak predictors of the outcome, with lower
coefficients than the personal variables in the Markov blanket. As a bonus the
coefficient between `education` and `job` was added, to show that the former
predicts the latter rather well.

## Conclusions about the Data
The SEM coefficients carry information about the relation between variables,
that can help us answer our research questions. Our first research question is
about which people the bank should target in their marketing campaign. The
coefficients tell us that people are more likely to say yes when they get 
older, when they are single, and when they have a higher education. They are
less inclined to say yes when they have credit in default, and when their job
pays more. However, these effects are very small.

The second research question is about when to call people. During model testing
we found that the moment of calling is one of the weakest predictors in the
data. Therefore we chose to get rid of the time and date variables, as such, 
we do not think the bank should focus on on this.

The third and final question is about the state of the economy. The 
coefficients of the SEM tell us that these variables are the best predictors of
the outcome. This means that the bank can gain much more by marketing at the
right time, rather than targeting the right people. When employment rate goes
up, outcomes are less positive. When the price and confidence indices go 
up, more positive outcomes occur. A sub-question to this one is whether the 
bank should target different people in different economic states. This is
something we are not able to answer this question with the coefficients from 
the SEM. On top of that, we found biases in the data that relate to changes in
the marketing campaign of the bank, that complicate answering this question.
For instance, the contact medium changed from landline to strictly cellular at
some point, and dependencies between a person's marital status and the national
economic state were found, which we assume is due to the bank's marketing
strategy.
