\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Companies engage in direct marketing campaigns by contacting potential
customers to reach a specific goal (e.g.~selling a product or service).
Communicating is often done by telephone, initiated from the company's
contact center. One of the biggest challenges the companies face is
estimating what people are most likely to buy their product: many calls
result in customers declining the offer. For a company to have a
successful marketing campaign, a sufficient number of customers must
follow up on their offer, otherwise it will cost more than it will bring
in.

Companies typically collect data about their campaign to improve their
success. In this project, we will use publicly available data from one
such campaign to build a Bayesian network model about the factors
involved in bank marketing.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

We use a publicly available bank marketing dataset retrieved from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository {[}1{]}. This dataset contains data
related to a direct marketing campaign by a Portuguese banking
institution based on phone calls. Each row in the table corresponds one
instance of telephonic contact with a potential customer in the latest
marketing campaign. Our Bayesian network will contain the following
variables related to a potential customer: Age, Eduction, Job, Marital
Status, whether they currently have a Housing Loan, whether they have
Credit in Default, and whether they have a Personal Loan. It will also
contain the following variables related to the call: the Contact type
(whether the potential customer used a mobile phone, landline), Contact
Month, Contact Weekday, amount of Days Since Last Contact, Previous
campaign outcome, Number of Contacts in this Campaign, Contact Duration,
and the Outcome of the call (whether the customer subscribes or not).
Lastly it will also contain these national economic variables: Consumer
Price Index, Consumer Confidence Level, 3 Month Euribor (European
banking loan) rate, Employment Rate, Employment Variation.

\subsection{Implementation}\label{implementation}}

\hypertarget{initial-causal-diagram}{%
\section{Initial causal diagram}\label{initial-causal-diagram}}

Our initial DAG as shown in \autoref{fig:initial_dag_small} was
constructed with our prior beliefs about the data. A bigger version of
this DAG is shown in the appendix (\autoref{sec:initial_dag}
\autoref{fig:initial_dag}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/initial_dag}
    \caption{Initial DAG as proposed in exposee.}
    \label{fig:initial_dag_small}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{testing-the-causal-diagram}{%
\section{Testing the causal diagram}\label{testing-the-causal-diagram}}

In this report we present the findings of testing and amending the
initial model as proposed in our exposee. The model was iteratively
tested using the \(\chi^2\)-test, removing and adding
variables/connections at each step.

Conditional independencies were automatically derived using the
\texttt{ImpliedLocalDependencies} function from the \texttt{dagitty}
package in \texttt{R}. The result of this can be found in
\autoref{sec:initial_conditional_dependencies}.

The function found a large amount of independencies, most of which are
associated with either economic variables, contact information, or with
the previous campaign. This is because we assumed these variables would
mainly have an effect on the outcome, but not on personal attributes,
with the exception of economic variables. In this report we put a big
emphasis on economic variables, because we realized that this affects
the bank heavily.

\hypertarget{approach}{%
\subsection{Approach}\label{approach}}

Tests were performed automatically using the \texttt{localTests}
function from the \texttt{dagitty} package. However, the data has some
attributes that can take on many different values. This would cause
issues, which is why we performed some pre-processing. These are the
attributes for which this was the case:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{variable} & \textbf{type} \\
    age & Discrete values between 18-85 \\
    nr.employed & continuous values \\
    emp.var.rate & continuous values \\
    cons.price.idx & continuous values \\
    cons.conf.idx & continuous values \\
    euribor3m & continuous values \\
\end{tabular}

\medskip

All other attributes were nominal values related to social and
economical status of the person.

\hypertarget{data-analysis}{%
\subsection{Data analysis}\label{data-analysis}}

Because \texttt{dagitty} interprets our data as nominal, it is necessary
to bin our data to allow for meaningful analysis. For each of these
attributes, we inspect the histogram of value frequencies, and we apply
domain knowledge to obtain acceptable bins.

\hypertarget{binning}{%
\subsubsection{Binning}\label{binning}}

We binned the data in following bins:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{Variable}           & \textbf{Split on} \\
    Age                         & 18, 25, 30, 45, 60 \\
    Consumer confidence         & 35, 38, 45 \\
    Price index \ 1000          & 92.6, 93.3, 93.6, 94.3 \\
    Empl. var. rate             & -0.5, 0.5, 2.1 \\
    Euribor \ 1000              & 3 \\
    Nr. employed                & 5050, 5150 \\
\end{tabular}

\medskip

For age, shown in \autoref{fig:age}, we used our domain knowledge to
choose stages of life (\(<18, 18-25, 26-30, ..., >60\)), whereas for the
economic variables we chose bins that seemed fit the data. For euribor,
shown in \autoref{fig:euribor3m}, we only chose 2 bins, because there
was a big gap in the middle of the range, resulting in 2 clusters.

\hypertarget{testing-strategy}{%
\subsubsection{Testing strategy}\label{testing-strategy}}

An iterative strategy was applied. In each iteration we ran
\texttt{localTests}, starting with parameter
\texttt{max.conditioning.variables} set to 0. We focused on the highest
RMSEA value, applying a change to the model each time, and running the
function again. This was repeated until we were satisfied (RMSEA values
\(<0.05\), unless independency was deemed illogical), at which point we
incremented the maximum amount of conditioning variables by 1, and
repeated the process.

\hypertarget{changes}{%
\subsection{Changes}\label{changes}}

A changelog of the findings of our testing strategy is described in the
subsections in this section.

\hypertarget{contact-type}{%
\subsubsection{Contact type}\label{contact-type}}

When we first tested the independencies of our DAG, we found a very
strong dependency between the contact type variable (indicating whether
the consumer reached on their cellphone or landline) and the month.
After a quick look, this seemed to be corresponding to the data we have,
so we added an arrow from month to contact type.

We also found a strong dependency between default and contact medium,
conditioned on age and job. Because the month is strongly influential on
the contact type, we deemed it likely that the month would have a
connection with default. We thought it would also be logical that some
months would be more expensive than others, so in these months people
are more likely to have a default.

We also found a dependency from education to contact. We might be able
to explain this because people with certain jobs need a mobile phone to
work efficiently.

Later on in the process, we found that the contact type was continually
the same over time, with a single point in time when it switched. The
first two years of the data collection was done via landline, while the
last three years all calls were made via a mobile phone. Because this is
skewed so heavily, we decided to delete the contact type attribute
altogether.

\hypertarget{latent-variables}{%
\subsubsection{Latent variables}\label{latent-variables}}

Education and duration were dependent on each other, conditioned on five
other variables. Because of this, added a latent variable called
patience. This latent variable disappeared again when we deleted
duration. We removed duration because it highly affects the output
target, but it is only known after a call is performed, thus not
offering any predictive / actionable information. The authors of the
paper that our data features in state that " this input should only be
included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention
is to have a realistic predictive model."

We also found a dependency between loan and housing, conditioned on age,
job and marital status. Another dependency between education and y
exists. Because of this, we add a latent variable ``willingness to take
a loan''. This latent variable has connections from age, marital status
and education, and has connections to housing, loan and y. All direct
connections between these variables were removed. This latent variable
later became wealth, where it has got connections to marital status and
default.

At first, we thought we could remove patience because the latent
variable wealth would suffice, but this wasn't the case. We could,
however, replace it with a direct connection between education to
duration.

\hypertarget{more-deletions}{%
\subsubsection{More deletions}\label{more-deletions}}

We read from the source of the dataset that duration is so closely
relate to y (outcome), that it should not be included in predictive
models. This is because, when people decide that they want a loan
(y=true), the call becomes much longer because of the further
administration that has to be done over the phone. This made us delete
the duration altogether.

Additionally, we deleted the attributes day\_of\_week and campaign
because they had no predictive value.

\hypertarget{economical-variables}{%
\subsubsection{Economical variables}\label{economical-variables}}

Because we are not economists, we did a little trial and error with the
economical values. All economical variables are updated every three
months. The connections we found are listed in the tables below.

Whether a person has a job depends partly on the global employment and
on the employment variation rate

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{from} & \textbf{to} \\
    emp.var.rate & job\\
    nr.employed & job 
\end{tabular}

\medskip

Whether a person can afford a house depends partly on the global
economy, so all four economic variables. This is also true for whether a
person needs a loan, and/or is in default.

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{from} & \textbf{to} \\
    emp.var.rate & housing \\
    nr.employed & housing \\ 
    cons.conf.idx & housing \\ 
    \medskip
    cons.price.idx & housing \\ 
    emp.var.rate & loan \\
    nr.employed & loan \\ 
    cons.conf.idx & loan \\ 
    \medskip
    cons.price.idx & loan \\
    emp.var.rate & default \\
    nr.employed & default \\ 
    cons.conf.idx & default \\ 
    cons.price.idx & default \\ 
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

The economical variables also influence one another. In short:
Employment rate influences the consumer indexes. This is because the
consumer economics do better when the job market performs better.

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{from} & \textbf{to} \\
    emp.var.rate & nr.employed \\
    emp.var.rate & cons.price.idx \\
    emp.var.rate & cons.conf.idx \\
    nr.employed & cons.price.idx \\ 
    nr.employed & cons.conf.idx \\ 
    cons.price.idx & cons.conf.idx \\ 
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

Euribor3m is the 3 month average interest rate of a group of European
banks. Banks also change their interest based on the current economical
climate. Because of this, we created dependencies from euribor3m to all
other economical variables. During testing we found that a lot of
combinations between euribor3m values and other economical variables
didn't exist in our data. This, and the fact that euribor3m only has two
bins, made the \texttt{localTests} function return an error when such a
combination occurred as a condition. Because the influence of the
euribor3m attribute is captured strongly by the other economical
variables, being dependent on it, we decided to delete the euribor3m
variable.

We found high RMSEA values between marital and economical variables,
conditioned on other economical variables. We think this is an illogical
dependency, likely to be an artefact in our dataset because of some
unobserved variable such as for instance company strategy, and decided
not to change our DAG to address this.

\hypertarget{revised-dag}{%
\subsubsection{Revised DAG}\label{revised-dag}}

Our revised and final DAG is shown in \autoref{fig:final_dag_small}. A
bigger version of this DAG is shown in the appendix
(\autoref{sec:final_dag} \autoref{fig:final_dag}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/final_dag}
    \caption{Initial DAG as proposed in expose.}
    \label{fig:final_dag_small}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{final-testing-results}{%
\subsubsection{Final testing results}\label{final-testing-results}}

The final testing values can be found in
\autoref{sec:final_test_results}. Because we focused conditional
independencies with an RMSEA value greater than 0.05, many
independencies have disappeared. Mainly, economic variables have been
connected with many other variables. We believe this was the right thing
to do because the overall state of the economy is a good predictor of an
individual's economical status and consequently, their willingness to
take out loans.

Still, some independencies with an RMSEA value \(\ge 0.5\) remain. This
is by choice. The RMSEA values that stand out the most are associated
with the \textit{marital} attribute in combination with economic
variables. We are convinced that these are coincidental, an artifact of
our binning, or an artifact of change in the marketing strategy of the
bank, and that no new edges or latent variables should be introduced to
explain them.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

We are happy with our final DAG, not just because it deals with most of
the high RMSEA values that we found, but also because we feel that the
edges drawn can be explained with reason.

Finally, we intended to analyse our latent variable \textit{wealth}
using the \texttt{lavaan} package, but since it expects different input
than \texttt{dagitty}, we did not have time to do so.

\hypertarget{structure-learning}{%
\section{Structure learning}\label{structure-learning}}

In this section we automatically construct a Bayesian network structure
for our dataset using a structure learning algorithm. The PC algorithm
(named after its authors, Peter and Clark) is the state-of-the-art
constraint based method for causal discovery. It is based on the
Inductive Causation (IC) algorithm by Pearl and Verma, 1991. It uses
many conditional independence tests, similar to the tests we performed
in the previous section.

\hypertarget{software}{%
\subsection{Software}\label{software}}

The \texttt{bnlearn} package implements various structure learning
algorithms. Their implementation of PC is called \texttt{pc.stable},
which takes the data, and many parameters, of which at least three must
be considered before learning network structure, which are the
following.

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{variable}   & \textbf{type} \\
    \texttt{test}       & the conditional independence test to \\
                        & use \\
    \texttt{alpha}      & target error rate \\
    \texttt{max.sx}     & maximum size of conditioning sets \\
                        & used in independence tests \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\hypertarget{early-observations}{%
\subsection{Early observations}\label{early-observations}}

In the previous section we binned the data to nominal values to use the
\(\chi^2\) test for conditional independencies. An RMSEA value greater
than 0.05 was considered to be too high for these tests, and a maximum
size of the conditioning sets was not set. We aim to learn a network
structure from the data that we can compare to the model that we created
ourselves, so our first structure learning approach was to use
\texttt{pc.stable} with
\texttt{test\ =\ \textquotesingle{}x2\textquotesingle{},\ alpha\ =\ 0.05,\ max.sx\ =\ NULL}.
This gave us an extremely sparse graph with many variables not having an
edge at all. Changing the test to other tests that are suitable for
nominal values, as well as changing the other two parameters had little
to no effect on the outcome. We assume the main reason for this to be
that many combinations of variables have too few samples, which causes
the conditional independence tests for nominal variables to be
unreliable or even undefined, especially when the size of the
conditioning set increases. This leads us to believe that we cannot work
with nominal values if we wish to learn a network structure that can be
compared with the network that we created in the previous section.

\hypertarget{approach-1}{%
\subsection{Approach}\label{approach-1}}

We aim to use the correlation test for independence, because it is
considered to be more robust, and mainly, it does not suffer from the
problem that we encountered. This test needs continuous variables. To
convert our data to continuous, we must again look into the data, as
well as use our domain knowledge to convert all variables to
\texttt{numeric} type in \texttt{R}.

\hypertarget{pre-processing}{%
\subsubsection{Pre-processing}\label{pre-processing}}

We start again from the unbinned data, with 41188 data points. The same
variables that were dropped in the the previous section are dropped from
the dataset again. That means that the variables \emph{contact, month,
day\_of\_week, duration, compaign, pdays, previous, poutcome} and
\emph{euribor3m} are out.

We will now discuss how the remaining variables were transformed to be
continuous.

\hypertarget{age-1}{%
\paragraph{Age}\label{age-1}}

This variable was already an integer, so we simply cast it to numeric.

\hypertarget{job}{%
\paragraph{Job}\label{job}}

This variable has 12 levels: \emph{admin., blue-collar, entrepreneur,
housemaid, management, retired, self-employed, services, student,
technician, unemployed, unknown}. The levels were grouped based on
salary, then mapped to a numeric value. The dataset is from Portugal,
but data from \href{https://money.usnews.com/}{usnews.com} was used to
estimate income, because it is publicly available. We came up with the
following groups along with their values:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{unknown, unemployed, retired, student}
\item
  \emph{housemaid, services, blue-coller}
\item
  \emph{admin., technician}
\item
  \emph{self-employed, entrepreneur}
\item
  \emph{management}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{marital}{%
\paragraph{Marital}\label{marital}}

This variable has 4 levels: \emph{divorced, married, single, unknown}.
There were only 80 \emph{unknown} entries, so these were added to
\emph{single}. Then, from this variable, the three binary variables
\emph{divorced, married, single} were created. These are often called
`dummy variables'.

\hypertarget{education}{%
\paragraph{Education}\label{education}}

This variable has 8 levels, which were simply ordered 1 through 9 from
low to high, before being cast to numeric. The order chosen is:
\emph{unknown, illiterate, basic.4y, basic.6y, basic.9y, high.school,
professional.course, university.degree}.

\hypertarget{default}{%
\paragraph{Default}\label{default}}

This variable has 3 levels: \emph{no, unknown, yes}. There were only 3
\emph{yes} entries, so these were added to \emph{unknown}. The variable
was then made binary with 0 representing \emph{no}, and 1 representing
\emph{unknown}.

\hypertarget{housing-loan}{%
\paragraph{Housing \& Loan}\label{housing-loan}}

These variables both have 3 levels: \emph{no, unknown, yes}. There were
exactly 990 \emph{unknown} entries in both, these were added to
\emph{no}. The variable was then made binary with 0 representing
\emph{no}, and 1 representing \emph{yes}.

\hypertarget{economic-variables}{%
\paragraph{Economic variables}\label{economic-variables}}

The four economic variables \emph{emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx,
cons.conf.idx, nr.employed} are already numeric, and were not altered.

\hypertarget{outcome}{%
\paragraph{Outcome}\label{outcome}}

Outcome variable \emph{y} has 2 levels: \emph{no, yes}. These were
simply mapped to 0 and 1, respectively.

\hypertarget{automatic-network-construction}{%
\subsubsection{Automatic network
construction}\label{automatic-network-construction}}

Now that the variables are converted to \texttt{numeric}, \ldots{}

\hypertarget{application}{%
\section{Application}\label{application}}

We are mainly interested in which variables influence the customer's
decision subscribing to a term deposit. We will be able to learn which
variables affect the decision, and how large their effect size is. Using
the final model, we can advise the bank about:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Which people should the bank target? For example, people with certain
  types of jobs or education might be more susceptible to a term
  deposit.
\item
  Given a certain person, what is the best time to call this him/her?
  For example, students do not like being called early in the morning.
\item
  How important is the current state of the economy for making this
  decision? Should the bank target different people as the economy
  evolves?
\end{itemize}
