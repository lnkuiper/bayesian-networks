## Data
We use a publicly available bank marketing dataset retrieved from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository [@dataset]. This dataset contains data related to a
direct marketing campaign by a Portuguese banking institution based on phone
calls. Each row in the table corresponds one instance of telephonic contact with
a potential customer in the latest marketing campaign. Our Bayesian network will
contain the following variables related to a potential customer: Age, Eduction,
Job, Marital Status, whether they currently have a Housing Loan, whether they
have Credit in Default, and whether they have a Personal Loan.  It will also
contain the following variables related to the call: the Contact type (whether
the potential customer used a mobile phone, landline), Contact Month, Contact
Weekday, amount of Days Since Last Contact, Previous campaign outcome, Number of
Contacts in this Campaign, Contact Duration, and the Outcome of the call
(whether the customer subscribes or not).  Lastly it will also contain these
national economic variables: Consumer Price Index, Consumer Confidence Level, 3
Month Euribor (European banking loan) rate, Employment Rate, Employment
Variation.
