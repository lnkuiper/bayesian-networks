# Introduction
Companies engage in direct marketing campaigns by contacting potential customers
to reach a specific goal (e.g. selling a product or service).  Communicating is
often done by telephone, initiated from the company's contact center.  One of
the biggest challenges the companies face is estimating which people are most
likely to buy their product: many calls result in customers declining the offer.
For a company to have a succesful marketing campaign, a sufficient number of
customers must follow up on their offer, otherwise it will cost more than it
will bring in.

Companies typically collect data about their campaign to improve their success.
In this project, we will use publicly available data from one such campaign to
build a Bayesian network model about the factors involved in bank marketing.
