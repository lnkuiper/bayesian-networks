# Testing the causal diagram
In this report we present the findings of testing and amending the initial model
as proposed in our exposee.  The model was iteratively tested using the
$\chi^2$-test, removing and adding variables/connections at each step.

Conditional independencies were automatically derived using the
`ImpliedLocalDependencies` function from the `dagitty` package in `R`. The
result of this can be found in \autoref{sec:initial_conditional_dependencies}.

The function found a large amount of independencies, most of which are
associated with either economic variables, contact information, or with the
previous campaign. This is because we assumed these variables would mainly have
an effect on the outcome, but not on personal attributes, with the exception of
economic variables. In this report we put a big emphasis on economic variables,
because we realized that this affects the bank heavily.

## Approach
Tests were performed automatically using the `localTests` function from the
`dagitty` package.  However, the data has some attributes that can take on many
different values. This would cause issues, which is why we performed some
pre-processing. These are the attributes for which this was the case:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{variable} & \textbf{type} \\
    age & Discrete values between 18-85 \\
    nr.employed & continuous values \\
    emp.var.rate & continuous values \\
    cons.price.idx & continuous values \\
    cons.conf.idx & continuous values \\
    euribor3m & continuous values \\
\end{tabular}

\medskip
All other attributes were nominal values related to social and economical status
of the person.

## Data analysis
Because `dagitty` interprets our data as nominal, it is necessary to bin our
data to allow for meaningful analysis. For each of these attributes, we inspect
the histogram of value frequencies, and we apply domain knowledge to obtain
acceptable bins.

### Binning
We binned the data in following bins:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{ll}
	\textbf{Variable}           & \textbf{Split on} \\
	Age                         & 18, 25, 30, 45, 60 \\
	Consumer confidence         & 35, 38, 45 \\
	Price index \ 1000          & 92.6, 93.3, 93.6, 94.3 \\
	Empl. var. rate             & -0.5, 0.5, 2.1 \\
	Euribor \ 1000              & 3 \\
	Nr. employed                & 5050, 5150 \\
\end{tabular}

\medskip
For age, shown in \autoref{fig:age}, we used our domain knowledge to choose
stages of life ($<18, 18-25, 26-30, ..., >60$), whereas for the economic
variables we chose bins that seemed fit the data. For euribor, shown in
\autoref{fig:euribor3m}, we only chose 2 bins, because there was a big gap in
the middle of the range, resulting in 2 clusters.

### Testing strategy
An iterative strategy was applied. In each iteration we ran `localTests`,
starting with parameter `max.conditioning.variables` set to 0. We focused on the
highest RMSEA value, applying a change to the model each time, and running the
function again. This was repeated until we were satisfied (RMSEA values $<0.05$,
unless independency was deemed illogical), at which point we incremented the
maximum amount of conditioning variables by 1, and repeated the process.

## Changes
A changelog of the findings of our testing strategy is described in the
subsections in this section. 

### Contact type
When we first tested the independencies of our DAG, we found a very strong
dependency between the contact type variable (indicating whether the consumer
reached on their cellphone or landline) and the month. After a quick look, this
seemed to be corresponding to the data we have, so we added an arrow from month
to contact type. 

We also found a strong dependency between default and contact medium,
conditioned on age and job. Because the month is strongly influential on the
contact type, we deemed it likely that the month would have a connection with
default. We thought it would also be logical that some months would be more
expensive than others, so in these months people are more likely to have a
default. 

We also found a dependency from education to contact. We might be able to
explain this because people with certain jobs need a mobile phone to work
efficiently. 

Later on in the process, we found that the contact type was continually the same
over time, with a single point in time when it switched. The first two years of
the data collection was done via landline, while the last three years all calls
were made via a mobile phone.  Because this is skewed so heavily, we decided to
delete the contact type attribute altogether. 

### Latent variables
Education and duration were dependent on each other, conditioned on five other
variables. Because of this, added a latent variable called patience. This latent
variable disappeared again when we deleted duration. We removed duration because
it highly affects the output target, but it is only known after a call is
performed, thus not offering any predictive / actionable information.  The
authors of the paper that our data features in state that " this input should
only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention
is to have a realistic predictive model."

We also found a dependency between loan and housing, conditioned on age, job and
marital status. Another dependency between education and y exists. Because of
this, we add a latent variable "willingness to take a loan". This latent
variable has connections from age, marital status and education, and has
connections to housing, loan and y. All direct connections between these
variables were removed. This latent variable later became wealth, where it has
got connections to marital status and default. 

At first, we thought we could remove patience because the latent variable wealth
would suffice, but this wasn't the case. We could, however, replace it with a
direct connection between education to duration. 

### More deletions
We read from the source of the dataset that duration is so closely relate to y
(outcome), that it should not be included in predictive models. This is because,
when people decide that they want a loan (y=true), the call becomes much longer
because of the further administration that has to be done over the phone. This
made us delete the duration altogether. 

Additionally, we deleted the attributes day\_of\_week and campaign because they
had no predictive value. 

### Economical variables
Because we are not economists, we did a little trial and error with the
economical values. All economical variables are updated every three months. The
connections we found are listed in the tables below. 

Whether a person has a job depends partly on the global employment and on the
employment variation rate

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{from} & \textbf{to} \\
    emp.var.rate & job\\
    nr.employed & job 
\end{tabular}

\medskip
Whether a person can afford a house depends partly on the global economy, so all
four economic variables. This is also true for whether a person needs a loan,
and/or is in default. 

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{from} & \textbf{to} \\
    emp.var.rate & housing \\
    nr.employed & housing \\ 
    cons.conf.idx & housing \\ 
    \medskip
    cons.price.idx & housing \\ 
    emp.var.rate & loan \\
    nr.employed & loan \\ 
    cons.conf.idx & loan \\ 
    \medskip
    cons.price.idx & loan \\
    emp.var.rate & default \\
    nr.employed & default \\ 
    cons.conf.idx & default \\ 
    cons.price.idx & default \\ 
\end{tabular}

\bigskip
The economical variables also influence one another. In short: Employment rate
influences the consumer indexes. This is because the consumer economics do
better when the job market performs better. 

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{from} & \textbf{to} \\
    emp.var.rate & nr.employed \\
    emp.var.rate & cons.price.idx \\
    emp.var.rate & cons.conf.idx \\
    nr.employed & cons.price.idx \\ 
    nr.employed & cons.conf.idx \\ 
    cons.price.idx & cons.conf.idx \\ 
\end{tabular}


\bigskip
Euribor3m is the 3 month average interest rate of a group of European banks.
Banks also change their interest based on the current economical climate.
Because of this, we created dependencies from euribor3m to all other economical
variables. During testing we found that a lot of combinations between euribor3m
values and other economical variables didn't exist in our data. This, and the
fact that euribor3m only has two bins, made the `localTests` function return an
error when such a combination occurred as a condition. Because the influence of
the euribor3m attribute is captured strongly by the other economical variables,
being dependent on it, we decided to delete the euribor3m variable.



We found high RMSEA values between marital and economical variables,
conditioned on other economical variables. We think this is an illogical
dependency, likely to be an artefact in our dataset because of some unobserved
variable such as for instance company strategy, and decided not to change our
DAG to address this.

### Revised DAG
Our revised and final DAG is shown in \autoref{fig:final_dag_small}.  A bigger
version of this DAG is shown in the appendix (\autoref{sec:final_dag}
\autoref{fig:final_dag}). 

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/final_dag}
	\caption{Final DAG after model testing.}
	\label{fig:final_dag_small}
\end{figure}

### Final testing results
The final testing values can be found in \autoref{sec:final_test_results}.
Because we focused conditional independencies with an RMSEA value greater than
0.05, many independencies have disappeared.  Mainly, economic variables have
been connected with many other variables.  We believe this was the right thing
to do because the overall state of the economy is a good predictor of an
individual's economical status and consequently, their willingness to take out
loans.

Still, some independencies with an RMSEA value $\ge 0.5$ remain. This is by
choice.  The RMSEA values that stand out the most are associated with the
\textit{marital} attribute in combination with economic variables.  We are
convinced that these are coincidental, an artifact of our binning, or an
artifact of change in the marketing strategy of the bank, and that no new edges
or latent variables should be introduced to explain them.

### Conclusion
We are happy with our final DAG, not just because it deals with most of the high
RMSEA values that we found, but also because we feel that the edges drawn can be
explained with reason.

Finally, we intended to analyse our latent variable \textit{wealth} using the
`lavaan` package, but since it expects different input than `dagitty`, we did
not have time to do so.
