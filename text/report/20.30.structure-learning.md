## Structure learning
In this section we automatically construct a Bayesian network structure for our
dataset using a structure learning algorithm.  The PC algorithm (named after its
authors, Peter and Clark) is the state-of-the-art constraint based method for
causal discovery.  It is based on the Inductive Causation (IC) algorithm by
Pearl and Verma, 1991.  It uses many conditional independence tests, similar to
the tests we performed in the previous section.

### Software
The `bnlearn` package implements various structure learning algorithms.  Their
implementation of PC is called `pc.stable`, which takes the data, and many
parameters, of which at least three must be considered before learning network
structure, which are the following.

                        & use \\
    \texttt{alpha}      & target error rate \\
    \texttt{max.sx}     & maximum size of conditioning sets \\
                        & used in independence tests \\
\end{tabular}

### Early observations
In the previous section we binned the data to nominal values to use the $\chi^2$
test for conditional independencies.  An RMSEA value greater than 0.05 was
considered to be too high for these tests, and a maximum size of the
conditioning sets was not set.  We aim to learn a network structure from the
data that we can compare to the model that we created ourselves, so our first
structure learning approach was to use `pc.stable` with `test = 'x2', alpha =
0.05, max.sx = NULL`.  This gave us an extremely sparse graph with many
variables not having an edge at all.  Changing the test to other tests that are
suitable for nominal values, as well as changing the other two parameters had
little to no effect on the outcome.  We assume the main reason for this to be
that many combinations of variables have too few samples, which causes the
conditional independence tests for nominal variables to be unreliable or even
undefined, especially when the size of the conditioning set increases.  This
leads us to believe that we cannot work with nominal values if we wish to learn
a network structure that can be compared with the network that we created in the
previous section.

### Approach
We aim to use the correlation test for independence, because it is considered to
be more robust, and mainly, it does not suffer from the problem that we
encountered.  This test needs continuous variables.  To convert our data to
continuous, we must again look into the data, as well as use our domain
knowledge to convert all variables to  `numeric` type in `R`.

#### Pre-processing
We start again from the unbinned data, with 41188 data points.  The same
variables that were dropped in the the previous section are dropped from the
dataset again.  That means that the variables _contact, month, day_of_week,
duration, compaign, pdays, previous, poutcome_ and _euribor3m_ are out.

We will now discuss how the remaining variables were transformed to be
continuous.

##### Age
This variable was already an integer, so we simply cast it to numeric.

##### Job
This variable has 12 levels: _admin., blue-collar, entrepreneur, housemaid,
management, retired, self-employed, services, student, technician, unemployed,
unknown_.  The levels were grouped based on salary, then mapped to a numeric
value.  The dataset is from Portugal, but data from
[usnews.com](https://money.usnews.com/) was used to estimate income, because it
is publicly available.  We came up with the following groups along with their
values:

  1. _unknown, unemployed, retired, student_
  2. _housemaid, services, blue-coller_
  3. _admin., technician_
  4. _self-employed, entrepreneur_
  5. _management_

##### Marital
This variable has 4 levels: _divorced, married, single, unknown_.
There were only 80 _unknown_ entries, so these were added to _single_.
Then, from this variable, the three binary variables _divorced, married, single_ were created.
These are often called 'dummy variables'.

##### Education
This variable has 8 levels, which were simply ordered 1 through 9 from low to high, before being cast to numeric.
The order chosen is: _unknown, illiterate, basic.4y, basic.6y, basic.9y, high.school, professional.course, university.degree_.

##### Default
This variable has 3 levels: _no, unknown, yes_.
There were only 3 _yes_ entries, so these were added to _unknown_.
The variable was then made binary with 0 representing _no_, and 1 representing _unknown_.

##### Housing & Loan
These variables both have 3 levels: _no, unknown, yes_.
There were exactly 990 _unknown_ entries in both, these were added to _no_.
The variable was then made binary with 0 representing _no_, and 1 representing _yes_.

##### Economic variables
The four economic variables _emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx, cons.conf.idx, nr.employed_ are already numeric, and were not altered.

##### Outcome
Outcome variable _y_ has 2 levels: _no, yes_.
These were simply mapped to 0 and 1, respectively.

#### Automatic network construction
Now that the variables are converted to `numeric`, ...
