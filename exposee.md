## Problem domain


## Data


## Application
We are mainly interested in what variables influence the decision of taking a
term deposit. We should be able to see what variables have a large effect, and
in what way. By doing this, we can advise the bank about two factors: 

  - What people should the bank choose? For example, people with certain types
      of jobs or education might be more susceptible to a term deposit. 
  - Given a certain person, what is the best timing to call this person? For
      example, students might not like being called at 9:00 in the morning. 
  - How important is a person's view on the current economy for making this
    decision? Should the bank call other people when the economy evolves?
